    # Every once in a while, a new NixOS release may change configuration
    # defaults in a way incompatible with stateful data. For instance, if the
    # default version of PostgreSQL changes, the new version will probably
    # be unable to read your existing databases. To prevent such breakage,
    # you should set the value of this option to the NixOS release with which
    # you want to be compatible. The effect is that NixOS will use defaults
    # corresponding to the specified release (such as using an older version
    # of PostgreSQL). Itâ€™s perfectly fine and recommended to leave this value
    # at the release version of the first install of this system. Changing this
    # option will not upgrade your system. In fact it is meant to stay constant
    # exactly when you upgrade your system. You should only bump this option, if
    # you are sure that you can or have migrated all state on your system which
    # is affected by this option.
