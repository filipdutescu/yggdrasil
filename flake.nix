      # Every once in a while, a new NixOS release may change configuration
      # defaults in a way incompatible with stateful data. For instance, if the
      # default version of PostgreSQL changes, the new version will probably
      # be unable to read your existing databases. To prevent such breakage,
      # you should set the value of this option to the NixOS release with which
      # you want to be compatible. The effect is that NixOS will use defaults
      # corresponding to the specified release (such as using an older version
      # of PostgreSQL). Itâ€™s perfectly fine and recommended to leave this value
      # at the release version of the first install of this system. Changing this
      # option will not upgrade your system. In fact it is meant to stay constant
      # exactly when you upgrade your system. You should only bump this option, if
      # you are sure that you can or have migrated all state on your system which
      # is affected by this option.
